Codr is your comprehensive guide to navigating the often overwhelming world after graduation. Designed to provide recent graduates with essential resources, advice, and tools, Codr aims to ease the transition from academic life to the professional world.

## Features
1. **Tips & Prep** – Some job search wisdom that might actually help.
2. **Curated resources** – Resume template, LeetCode practice roadmap, free courses, a GitHub repo with real interview questions asked in some technical interviews, and more.
3. **Pakistani Tech Company Directory** – So you can browse their careers pages, LinkedIn profiles, and apply if they’re hiring.

It’s still a work in progress—an MVP, if you will—but I’ll keep refining it and adding more features to it.
